# O’Neill Tensor Curvature Codes

This repository provides computational and numerical tools accompanying the
monograph and associated preprints on sectional curvature structures in
fibred Calabi–Yau manifolds, developed using the theory of Riemannian
submersions and O’Neill’s tensorial curvature decomposition.

The codes support the analysis of horizontal–vertical curvature interactions,
mixed sectional curvature phenomena, and curvature bounds in Ricci-flat
settings arising from nontrivial fibration geometry.

## Associated Work
These codes accompany the preprint/monograph:

**Submersion Bounds on Fibred Calabi–Yau Geometry via O’Neill Tensors**

which develops a systematic curvature decomposition framework for elliptic,
toroidal, and K3-fibred Calabi–Yau manifolds, with applications to geometric
analysis and string-theoretic compactifications.

## Scope
The repository supports analytical and computational investigations of:
- O’Neill \(A\)- and \(T\)-tensors and their norms
- Horizontal, vertical, and mixed sectional curvature components
- Curvature bounds and stability under collapsing limits
- Applications to moduli space geometry and related physical models
